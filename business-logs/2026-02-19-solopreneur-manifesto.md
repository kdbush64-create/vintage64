**DATE:** 2026-02-19  
**ORIGIN:** Fort Worth, TX HQ  
**SCOPE:** CONUS (Continental US)  
**SUBJECT:** Why the Solopreneur Edition is the Last Website You’ll Ever Buy.

### 1. THE GEOGRAPHIC UPLINK: NATIONAL REACH, LOCAL VALUES
While my boots are on the ground in **Fort Worth, Texas**, my digital footprint is strictly **US-Domestic**. 

I don't outsource. I don't offshore. Whether you are across the street in Tarrant County or across the country in a different time zone, you get a **CompTIA-certified partner** who understands US business standards and security. We handle everything via secure phone, email, and remote sync. No "lost in translation" delays—just direct, domestic precision.

### 2. THE "DIGITAL RENT" TRAP
Most solopreneurs are being bled dry by "drag-and-drop" builders.
* **The Math:** $20/mo (Builder) + $15 (Email) + $10 (Booking Plugins) = **$500+ every single year.**
* **The Reality:** You are a tenant. If you stop paying their rising fees, they delete your business. You don't own the code; you just rent the space.
* **The V64 Fix:** I build on global edge networks where my clients often pay **$0.00 in monthly hosting.** You own the asset. You are the landlord.

### 3. PERFORMANCE IS REVENUE
Most agencies sell you a "pretty" site built on a bloated WordPress foundation.
* **The Problem:** 53% of users leave a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. A heavy, plugin-ridden site is a lead-killer.
* **The V64 Fix:** My sites are **Hand-Coded Static HTML.** No database to hack. No plugins to break. They score 100/100 on Google PageSpeed. Your customers get what they want instantly, anywhere in the US.
